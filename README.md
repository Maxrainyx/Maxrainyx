👋 Hi, my name is Max
<p> 
  🌱 I've gratuated from Python course at SkillFactory, INTPY. Now I'm a Python developer👨‍💻 and looking for new opportunities 😎
</p>
<p>
  Have been passionate about all the IT-things for a long time. In my school years, studied Pascal and set up databases. In 2019, started learning HTML/CSS on Udemy, and later on, enjoyed courses on Python, which have since chosen as my programming language.
